Open VS Code.
Use the terminal and move to your project folder:
- cd C:\Users\Madhur\PycharmProjects\websitesproject

2️⃣ Activate Your Virtual Environment
Since you created a virtual environment (venv_vscode), activate it:
- .\venv_vscode\Scripts\Activate.ps1

If activation fails, check if PowerShell execution is restricted by running:
- Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

Then try activating the virtual environment again.

3️⃣ Install Dependencies (Only If Needed)
If you haven't installed all required packages or need to reinstall them, run
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t have a requirements.txt, create one by running:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run Your PyTest Tests
